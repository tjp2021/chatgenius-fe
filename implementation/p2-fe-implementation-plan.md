# ChatGenius Frontend Implementation Plan - Phase 2 (Updated)

## Overview
This document outlines the updated implementation plan for Phase 2 of the ChatGenius frontend integration, aligning with the new API structure.

## Current Status
Based on the updated p2-fe-integration.md requirements, we need to refactor our implementation to use REST endpoints for channel operations while keeping socket events for real-time features.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 2A: API Infrastructure

#### REST API Setup
- [ ] Channel Management
  - [ ] List channels (GET /channels)
  - [ ] Create channel (POST /channels)
  - [ ] Update channel (PUT /channels/:id)
  - [ ] Delete channel (DELETE /channels/:id)
  - [ ] Get channel members (GET /channels/:id/members)
- [ ] Channel Invitations
  - [ ] Create invitation (POST /channels/:channelId/invitations)
  - [ ] Accept invitation (POST /channels/invitations/:invitationId/accept)
  - [ ] Reject invitation (POST /channels/invitations/:invitationId/reject)
  - [ ] Get pending invitations (GET /channels/invitations/pending)

#### Authentication Enhancement
- [ ] API Headers Configuration
  - [ ] Implement Clerk JWT token integration
  - [ ] Set up Content-Type headers
  - [ ] Configure authorization headers

#### Error Handling Infrastructure
- [ ] HTTP Error Handling
  - [ ] Handle network errors
  - [ ] Handle rate limiting
  - [ ] Implement retry logic
- [ ] Error Types Definition
  - [ ] Authentication errors
  - [ ] API errors
  - [ ] Validation errors

### Phase 2B: WebSocket Infrastructure

#### WebSocket Connection Management
- [ ] Connection Setup
  - [ ] Implement WebSocket authentication with token
  - [ ] Configure websocket transport
  - [ ] Set up connection state tracking
- [ ] Event Handling
  - [ ] Handle connect/disconnect events
  - [ ] Process offline messages
  - [ ] Clean typing indicators

#### Real-time Features
- [ ] Message Events
  - [ ] Handle message.created
  - [ ] Handle message.updated
  - [ ] Handle message.deleted
  - [ ] Handle message.delivered
  - [ ] Handle message.seen
- [ ] Typing Indicators
  - [ ] Implement typing start/stop
  - [ ] Add 5s expiration
  - [ ] Add 500ms debounce

### Phase 2C: Channel System

#### Channel Operations
- [ ] REST Endpoints
  - [ ] Implement channel creation
  - [ ] Handle channel updates
  - [ ] Manage channel deletion
  - [ ] Handle member management
- [ ] Channel Types
  - [ ] Public channels
  - [ ] Private channels
  - [ ] Direct messages

#### Channel Events
- [ ] Real-time Updates
  - [ ] Handle channel.updated
  - [ ] Handle channel.member_joined
  - [ ] Handle channel.member_left
- [ ] State Management
  - [ ] Channel cleanup
  - [ ] Member list updates
  - [ ] Status indicators

### Phase 2D: Message System

#### Message Operations
- [ ] Core Functionality
  - [ ] Send messages
  - [ ] Update messages
  - [ ] Delete messages
  - [ ] Handle threaded replies
- [ ] Message Status
  - [ ] Track delivery status
  - [ ] Implement read receipts
  - [ ] Handle offline messages

#### Message UI
- [ ] Components
  - [ ] Message list
  - [ ] Input field
  - [ ] Status indicators
  - [ ] Error states
- [ ] Features
  - [ ] Optimistic updates
  - [ ] Loading states
  - [ ] Error recovery

## Priority Order

1. **High Priority**
   - REST API infrastructure
   - Channel management
   - Basic message functionality
   - Error handling

2. **Medium Priority**
   - WebSocket real-time features
   - Typing indicators
   - Message delivery tracking
   - Channel events

3. **Lower Priority**
   - UI polish
   - Advanced features
   - Performance optimizations

## Success Criteria

### Technical Requirements
- Functional REST API integration
- Stable WebSocket connection
- Reliable message delivery
- Proper error handling

### User Experience Requirements
- Seamless channel management
- Real-time updates
- Clear error messages
- Smooth offline/online transitions

## Notes
- Each phase should include thorough testing
- Documentation should be updated as features are implemented
- Code reviews should focus on error handling and edge cases
- Regular performance monitoring should be implemented

## Next Steps
1. Begin with REST API infrastructure
2. Update channel management to use REST endpoints
3. Implement WebSocket connection for real-time features
4. Add comprehensive error handling

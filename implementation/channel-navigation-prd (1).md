# Channel Navigation and Default Views PRD

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Problem Statement
Users need a clear and intuitive way to navigate channels within the ChatGenius platform. The system must provide a consistent landing experience and organized channel management through a modal interface.

### 1.2 Goals
- Create a consistent and intuitive channel navigation experience
- Provide clear entry points for new users
- Maintain clear organization between public, private, and DM channels
- Enable efficient channel management through a modal interface

## 2. User States and Behaviors

### 2.1 Default Landing Page
- All authenticated users land at `/channels`
- The default view includes:
  - Welcome message and platform introduction
  - Channel type explanations (Public, Private, DMs)
  - Getting started guide
  - Tips & tricks section
  - Help resources
- This page serves as the central hub for all channel-related activities

### 2.2 Channel Browse Modal
The modal interface provides two main tabs:

#### Public Channels Tab
- Shows all available PUBLIC channels that the user has NOT joined
- Each channel displays:
  - Channel name
  - Description
  - Member count
  - Join button

#### Joined Channels Tab
Organized into three distinct sections:
1. Joined Public Channels
   - Shows public channels user is a member of
   - Displays leave button for each channel
2. Joined Private Channels
   - Shows private channels user is a member of
   - Displays leave button for each channel
3. Direct Messages
   - Shows all DM conversations
   - Displays leave button for each DM

### 2.3 Channel Leave Behavior
When a user leaves a channel:
- Modal remains open
- Joined channels list re-renders to show remaining channels
- No redirection occurs
- Different behaviors based on user role:
  
  #### Channel Owner
  - Presented with two options:
    1. Leave Channel: Maintains channel and message history for remaining members
    2. Delete Channel: Permanently removes channel and all message history
  
  #### Regular Member
  - Single option to leave channel
  - Channel and message history remains intact for other members

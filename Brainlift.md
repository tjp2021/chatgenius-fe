Prompt: Socket event handling standardization and type safety improvements

Problem Analysis [CG-20240116-003]

- **Issue Description**: Socket event handling in the chat application lacks standardization, type safety, and proper cleanup patterns
- **Symptoms**: 
  - Inconsistent event naming across the codebase
  - Missing type definitions for event payloads
  - Mismatch between event registration and cleanup methods
  - Hard-coded string literals for event names
- **Impact**: 
  - Potential for runtime errors due to typos in event names
  - Type safety issues with event payloads
  - Risk of memory leaks from mismatched event cleanup
- **Initial Investigation**: 
  - Event names are scattered as string literals
  - Event payloads lack proper TypeScript interfaces
  - Cleanup methods don't mirror registration methods
- **Root Cause Hypotheses**: 
  - No centralized event name management
  - Missing standardized payload types
  - Asymmetric event registration/cleanup API

Solution Attempts [CG-20240116-003]

- **Attempt 1**: Added event name constants
  ```typescript
  const SOCKET_EVENTS = {
    MESSAGE: {
      NEW: 'message:new',
      SEND: 'message:send',
      CONFIRM: 'message:confirm'
    },
    CHANNEL: { ... }
  } as const;
  ```
  - Result: Eliminated string literal duplication
  - Learnings: Constants provide better maintainability and type safety

- **Attempt 2**: Added typed event payloads
  ```typescript
  interface ChannelEventPayload {
    channelId: string;
    userId?: string;
    timestamp?: number;
  }
  
  interface MessageEventPayload<T = Message> {
    message: T;
    channelId: string;
    timestamp: number;
  }
  ```
  - Result: Better type safety for event data
  - Learnings: Generic types allow flexibility while maintaining safety

Final Solution [CG-20240116-003]

- **Solution Description**: 
  - Centralized event name management with constants
  - Type-safe event payloads
  - Symmetric event registration/cleanup methods
  - Consistent method naming pattern

- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Event constants prevent typos and enable autocompletion
  2. Typed payloads ensure data consistency
  3. Matching `on`/`off` methods for each event type
  4. All event methods use the centralized constants

- **Verification**: 
  - TypeScript compiler enforces event name consistency
  - Payload types ensure data structure compliance
  - Symmetric methods make cleanup more reliable

- **Side Effects**: 
  - Slightly more verbose initial setup
  - Need to update event names in one place
  - Better IDE support and type inference

Lessons Learned [CG-20240116-003]

- **Technical Insights**: 
  - Centralized constants reduce maintenance burden
  - TypeScript interfaces improve code reliability
  - Symmetric APIs make usage more intuitive

- **Process Improvements**: 
  - Define event contracts (names and payloads) before implementation
  - Use TypeScript's type system to enforce patterns
  - Create matching cleanup methods for each registration method

- **Prevention Strategies**: 
  - Always use constants for event names
  - Define payload types upfront
  - Create symmetric registration/cleanup methods
  - Use TypeScript's const assertions for string literals

- **Documentation Updates**: 
  - Document event payload structures
  - Update socket client API documentation
  - Add examples of proper event handling patterns

Problem Analysis [CG-20231218-001]

- **ID**: CG-20231218-001
- **Error Description**: After updating channel browsing API endpoints to `/channels/browse/*`, several components still contain outdated code and inconsistent implementations, potentially causing sync issues with channel memberships.

- **Root Cause Hypotheses**: 
  1. Incomplete API migration:
     - Components still using deprecated `/channels` endpoint
     - Inconsistent parameter naming (snake_case vs camelCase)
  2. Dead code from partial implementation:
     - Commented out read state tracking
     - Unused features in navigation hooks

- **Steps to Reproduce**: 
  1. Check `src/app/channels/browse/page.tsx`:
     - Using old `/channels` endpoint instead of `/channels/browse/public`
     - Query parameters not matching API spec
  2. Check `src/components/channel-list.tsx`:
     - Using old `/channels` endpoint instead of `/channels/browse/joined`
  3. Check `src/components/browse-channels-modal.tsx`:
     - Using inconsistent parameter naming (`sort_by` vs `sortBy`)
  4. Check `src/hooks/useChannelNavigation.ts`:
     - Contains commented out read state tracking code

- **Logs or Relevant Information**:
  Affected files and their issues:
  ```typescript
  // src/app/channels/browse/page.tsx
  const { data: channels = [], isLoading } = useQuery({
    queryFn: async () => {
      const response = await api.get('/channels', {  // OLD endpoint
        params: {
          search,
          sortBy,
          sortOrder,
          type: 'PUBLIC'
        }
      });
      return response.data;
    },
  });

  // src/components/browse-channels-modal.tsx
  sort_by: 'member_count',  // Inconsistent naming
  sort_order: 'desc'

  // src/hooks/useChannelNavigation.ts
  // Mark previous as read (if exists)  // Dead code
  if (currentChannel) {
    // Implementation depends on your read state tracking
  }
  ```

Solution Walkthrough [CG-20231218-001]

- **ID**: CG-20231218-001
- **Solution Description**: Implemented a unified socket-based channel management system with proper state synchronization
- **Why It Worked**: 
  1. **Single Source of Truth**: Moved from a hybrid REST/WebSocket approach to a pure WebSocket-based implementation
  2. **Proper State Management**: 
     - Created a dedicated `useChannels` hook for socket operations
     - Simplified the channel context to be a thin wrapper around the socket hook
     - Removed duplicate state management code
  3. **Clear Component Hierarchy**:
     - `useChannels` (socket logic) → `ChannelContext` (state distribution) → Components (UI)
  4. **Type Safety**: Improved type definitions and consistency across components
  5. **Event Handling**: Proper socket event handling with cleanup

Learning Lessons [CG-20231218-001]

- **ID**: CG-20231218-001
- **Pattern Recognition**:
  1. **Anti-Pattern**: Mixing REST and WebSocket state management led to synchronization issues
  2. **Anti-Pattern**: Multiple hooks managing the same state (`useChannels`, `use-channel.ts`)
  3. **Anti-Pattern**: Inconsistent naming conventions (`useChannels` vs `useChannelContext`)

- **Prevention Strategies**:
  1. Choose a single source of truth for real-time data (WebSocket in this case)
  2. Implement a clear state management hierarchy
  3. Use consistent naming conventions across the application
  4. Maintain proper TypeScript types for better error detection

- **Best Practices Learned**:
  1. **Socket Management**:
     - Initialize socket connections early
     - Handle connection/disconnection gracefully
     - Clean up event listeners properly
  2. **State Management**:
     - Single responsibility principle for hooks
     - Clear separation between data fetching and state distribution
     - Consistent error handling
  3. **Component Architecture**:
     - Use context for state distribution
     - Keep components focused on UI concerns
     - Maintain consistent prop and event handling patterns

- **Future Recommendations**:
  1. **Documentation**:
     - Document WebSocket events and their payloads
     - Maintain a clear state management guide
     - Document component responsibilities
  2. **Testing**:
     - Add unit tests for socket event handlers
     - Add integration tests for state synchronization
     - Add error boundary tests
  3. **Monitoring**:
     - Add telemetry for socket connection status
     - Monitor state synchronization issues
     - Track error rates and types

**Technical Implementation Details**:
1. `useChannels` Hook:
   ```typescript
   - Handles socket events (connect, disconnect, channel updates)
   - Manages channel state (join, leave, update)
   - Provides error handling and loading states
   ```

2. `ChannelContext`:
   ```typescript
   - Distributes channel state to components
   - Manages current channel selection
   - Provides channel operations interface
   ```

3. Component Updates:
   ```typescript
   - Updated imports to use useChannelContext
   - Removed duplicate state management
   - Improved type safety
   ```

Problem Analysis [CG-20240108-002]

- **ID**: CG-20240108-002
- **Error Description**: Browse channels modal showing inconsistent channel membership state - empty public channels list despite existing public channels, and incorrect joined channels list.
- **Root Cause Hypotheses**: 
  1. Frontend filtering logic causing state inconsistency
  2. Caching issues with React Query
  3. Race conditions between channel lists
  4. Backend API returning incorrect data (confirmed as actual cause)
- **Steps to Reproduce**: 
  1. Open browse channels modal
  2. Observe empty public channels list
  3. Observe incorrect joined channels list
  4. Compare with database showing different state
- **Logs or Relevant Information**:
```javascript
// Console logs showed:
- Auth state correct (isAuthenticated: true, isSyncChecking: false)
- Public channels response: {status: 200, channelCount: 0}
- Joined channels response: {status: 200, channelCount: 3}
- Database showed different state than API responses
```

Solution Walkthrough [CG-20240108-002]

- **ID**: CG-20240108-002
- **Solution Description**: Implemented comprehensive frontend debugging to isolate the issue:
  1. Removed all client-side filtering
  2. Added detailed request/response logging
  3. Improved error handling and state management
  4. Added query state debugging
  5. Implemented proper cache invalidation
- **Why It Worked**: 
  - The enhanced debugging clearly showed the backend was returning incorrect data
  - Proved frontend was correctly handling responses
  - Eliminated frontend as source of inconsistency
  - Led to discovery of backend filtering issue
- **Key Lessons**:
  - Trust but verify: Even when frontend looks wrong, thorough debugging can reveal backend issues
  - Logging at key points helped isolate the issue
  - Removing client-side filtering simplified the system

Learning Lessons [CG-20240108-002]

- **Pattern Recognition**:
  1. When state inconsistencies occur, check both frontend and backend
  2. Empty arrays with 200 status codes often indicate filtering issues
  3. Comparing database state with API responses quickly reveals discrepancies

- **Prevention Strategies**:
  1. Implement comprehensive logging at key points
  2. Remove client-side data manipulation where possible
  3. Add explicit error handling for edge cases
  4. Use TypeScript to ensure type safety
  5. Implement proper cache invalidation strategies

- **Best Practices Learned**:
  1. Keep data transformation logic on the backend
  2. Use React Query's built-in cache management
  3. Add detailed debugging information in development
  4. Implement proper error boundaries and fallbacks
  5. Use TypeScript for better type safety

- **Future Recommendations**:
  1. Add API response validation
  2. Implement end-to-end tests for channel membership flows
  3. Add monitoring for empty array responses that should have data
  4. Create development tools for viewing backend state
  5. Add automated tests for membership state changes

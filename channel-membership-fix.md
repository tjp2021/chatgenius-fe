# Channel Display Issue Analysis [CG-20231218-001]

## Backend Implementation Review

### Current Implementation Status
1. The `getJoinedChannels` method in `browse.service.ts` correctly filters channels by membership:
```typescript
where: {
  members: {
    some: { userId }, // This ensures only channels where user is a member
  }
}
```

2. Existing Features Confirmed:
- ✅ Proper membership filtering
- ✅ Role information included (`isOwner` field)
- ✅ Join/leave functionality
- ✅ Soft delete support through Prisma schema

### Backend Verification
The backend is correctly:
- Only returning channels where the user is a member in `/channels/browse/joined`
- Including proper role information
- Implementing proper authorization checks

## Revised Problem Analysis

The initial problem analysis was based on incorrect assumptions. Since the backend is functioning correctly, we need to:

1. Frontend Investigation Needed:
   - Verify how the channel data is being processed after receipt
   - Check for any client-side filtering or transformation issues
   - Review the React Query implementation and caching strategy

2. Performance Optimization Opportunities:
   - Add database indexes for frequently queried fields
   - Implement more comprehensive test coverage
   - Enhance API documentation

## Recommended Actions

1. Frontend Investigation:
   - Review channel data processing in the frontend components
   - Verify React Query cache invalidation logic
   - Check socket event handlers for proper state updates

2. Performance Improvements:
   - Add suggested database indexes
   - Expand test coverage
   - Update API documentation

3. Monitoring:
   - Add performance monitoring for API queries
   - Implement better error logging
   - Add request/response logging for debugging

## Next Steps

1. Would you like assistance with:
   - Frontend code review to identify potential issues
   - Implementation of performance improvements
   - Enhancement of test coverage and documentation
   - Setting up monitoring and logging

2. Specific areas to investigate in the frontend:
   - Channel list rendering logic
   - Socket event handling
   - State management implementation
   - Cache invalidation strategy

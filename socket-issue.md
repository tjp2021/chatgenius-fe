# Socket.IO Channel Join Issue

## Issue Description
Socket connection establishes successfully but channel join requests timeout with no server response. Multiple attempts show the same pattern. **Critical Issue**: Event naming convention mismatch between client and server.

## Technical Details

### Connection (Working)
- Socket connects successfully (ID: `9A4M5XnrWhhn_I2HAAAA1`)
- Authentication passes
- Transport: WebSocket
- Protocol: undefined (Potential Issue)
- Connection state: `connected`

### Event Naming Mismatch (Critical)
Client is using dot notation while server expects colon notation:
- Client sends: `channel.join`
- Server expects: `channel:join`

### Connection Details
```javascript
Socket ID: 9A4M5XnrWhhn_I2HAAAA1
Transport: websocket
Protocol: undefined
Auth: {
  token: 'ey2hbGc...', // JWT token
  userId: 'user_2rJq9KAUZ8ssqEwo8S1IYtvwLKq'
}
```

### Join Attempts (All Failing)
```javascript
// First Attempt
[Socket] Attempting to join channel 20d6a357-91e3-4ffe-afdd-5b4c688a775f. Connection state: connected
[Socket] Emitting channel.join event for channel: 20d6a357-91e3-4ffe-afdd-5b4c688a775f
[Socket] Channel join timeout - no response received
Join response: { success: false, error: 'Server did not respond to join request' }

// Second Attempt
[Socket] Attempting to join channel 20d6a357-91e3-4ffe-afdd-5b4c688a775f. Connection state: connected
[Socket] Emitting channel.join event for channel: 20d6a357-91e3-4ffe-afdd-5b4c688a775f
[Socket] Channel join timeout - no response received
Join response: { success: false, error: 'Server did not respond to join request' }

// Third Attempt
[Socket] Attempting to join channel 20d6a357-91e3-4ffe-afdd-5b4c688a775f. Connection state: connected
[Socket] Emitting channel.join event for channel: 20d6a357-91e3-4ffe-afdd-5b4c688a775f
[Socket] Channel join timeout - no response received
Join response: { success: false, error: 'Server did not respond to join request' }
```

### Symptoms
- No response from server within 5s timeout
- No error events received
- No acknowledgment callback triggered
- No `channel:joined` or `channel:error` events received
- Socket protocol is undefined (may indicate version mismatch)
- Multiple attempts result in the same timeout
- **Root Cause Identified**: Event names use incorrect separator (. instead of :)

## Debugging Notes
1. Connection is stable (no disconnects)
2. Authentication successful (no auth errors)
3. Events are emitted but with incorrect naming convention
4. No error responses received because server doesn't recognize the event names
5. Server doesn't respond to join request due to event name mismatch
6. Undefined protocol might indicate version mismatch between client and server
7. Error pattern is consistent across multiple attempts

## Required Fixes
1. Update all event names in socket client to use colon (:) notation:
   - Change `channel.join` to `channel:join`
   - Change `channel.joined` to `channel:joined`
   - Change `channel.error` to `channel:error`
   - Change `channel.leave` to `channel:leave`

2. Verify server handlers match the documented events:
   - `channel:join`
   - `channel:leave`
   - `channel:created`
   - `channel:updated`
   - `channel:deleted`
   - `channel:member_count`

3. Update event listeners to match server events:
   ```typescript
   {
     channelId: string;  // UUID format
     userId: string;     // Clerk user ID
   }
   ```
